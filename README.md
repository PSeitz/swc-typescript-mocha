# swc-typescript-mocha
example project using swc with mocha and typescript

### run mocha tests with swc
`npm test`

### VS-Code debugging
There is a vscdoe launch.json to run the mocha tests from witihn vscode.
There are entries with babel and swc, but the swc breakpoints don't work correctly, probably related to missing sourcemaps.
